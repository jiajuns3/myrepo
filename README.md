## Quick Overview
My name is Jiajun Shen.

I am a MAPSS student majoring in __Psychology__. My research interest mainly focuese on addiction and decision making. I have no previous background in coding and programming, so I assumed that this course might become a great challenge for me, but I will try my best to explore.
